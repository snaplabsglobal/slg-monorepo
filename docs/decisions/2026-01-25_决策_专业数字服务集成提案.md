# Proposal: Professional Digital Service Integration

**To: Branch Manager (Emco / Andrew Sheret)**
**From: SnapLabs Global Inc. (JobSite Snap Team)**

### 1. The Goal

To empower local plumbers and HVAC technicians with **"Digital Equipment IDs"** (QR stickers) that professionalize their service and ensure long-term customer loyalty.

### 2. The Value for Your Branch

* **Customer Success**: By providing free, high-durability service stickers, you are helping your plumber clients secure their future business. A professional client stays in business longer and buys more parts from you.
* **Zero Cost, High Tech**: We provide the stickers and the software platform for free. Your branch acts as the "innovation hub" that brings 2026 technology to the trade counter.
* **Co-Branding**: Stickers can feature a "Recommended by [Wholesaler Name]" tag, strengthening the bond between you and the technicians.

### 3. How it Works

* We place a "Service Snap" display box on your counter.
* Plumbers take a pack of free, weather-proof QR stickers.
* When they install a part bought from you, they stick the QR code on the unit.
* They scan it to register the service. The machine is now "digitally managed" by them through our JSS "Home Hero" app.

### 4. Next Step

We would like to run a **2-week pilot program** at this branch. We will provide 500 premium stickers and a counter display at no cost to you.
